## Zamora

### Scene 1

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>

  Zamora mentions seeing two other people in the room when she got to the scene of the crime: an old lady, and a tall man. She also remembers seeing another person but can't remember who.
  
  Process of elimination! If she already told you she saw two of the suspects there, **interrogate the other suspects, and see if they mention being there too.**

  Then, pin the line where they say they were at the scene of the crime, and bring it back to Zamora.

  It was Billy! After unlocking Billy's second scene, pin the line where he says **he was there and saw everything**, and bring it back to Zamora.

</details>

### Scene 2

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>

  Zamora says she might have met Bethany, the old turtle lady, before, but isn't too sure.

  You need to find any line that says that **the two of them have definitely met in the past.**

## Richard
