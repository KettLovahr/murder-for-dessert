# Murder for Dessert

You're **Brennan**, a detective hired to investigate the murder of Phillip Bezerra in the fanciest restaurant around: *The Grand Apricot*. Talk to the suspects, keep their lines in mind, and point out important inconsistencies and relationships between their accounts. It's up to you to get to the bottom of this case, so dig deep, expose the culprit and bring them to Justice!

## Instructions
Entering *The Grand Apricot*, you'll be presented with the numerous colourful suspects. Click on any one of them to initiate a conversation.

When you do, you'll see a panel on the right-hand side of your screen showing your progress extracting information from them. Click any button with a dialogue bubble to start talking.

During conversations, you'll see a little pin next to the suspect's dialogue box, if you think that line might be important, **put a pin on it** by clicking the Pin icon. This will put that line in your Inventory and from there you can read it, or use it during any other conversation to help you uncover the truth.

If you can no longer get any information, you'll be **BRICK WALLED**, and the buttons will reflect that, move on to someone else, or see if you missed anything!
